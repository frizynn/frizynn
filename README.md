# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Juan Francisco Lebrero, a dedicated student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence Engineering at the University of San AndrÃ©s ([UdeSA](https://udesa.edu.ar)), currently working at [Notimation](https://notimation.com/es). Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, you'll find an extensive portfolio showcasing my notable projects and contributions in the field of AI and software development.


## ðŸŒŸ Skills and Expertise

- **Languages**: Python, Java, HTML, C
- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch, OpenCV, Langchain


## ðŸš€ Notable Projects

### Gesture-to-Text Translation

- Created an AI system that recognizes hand gestures and translates them into text using computer vision techniques and deep learning models.
- Implemented the project using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow, enabling real-time translation of hand gestures.


### Facial Expression Recognition for Mood Detection

- Developed an AI model to detect and classify facial expressions, enabling accurate mood detection.
- Leveraged deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow and OpenCV, to train the model on extensive facial expression datasets.

### Mountain Climbing Optimization Program

- Utilization of optimization algorithms to determine the best climbing route (for instance, gradient descent).
- Implementation of a model that considers variables such as altitude and slope.
- A refined graphical user interface (GUI) crafted using Tkinter, showcasing real-time updates on the climbers' progress and dynamically rendering the mountain.
